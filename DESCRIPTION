Description: A hydrograph is the temporal variation of the flow of water 
    and it can be interesting to isolate each peak (event) in order to better characterize the hydrology of 
    a river. However, some rivers have hydroelectric facilities that disturb the natural hydrology. 
    This package aims 
    (i) to isolate each hydrological event, 
    (ii) to determine whether it is of natural origin or caused by a hydroelectric power plant, and 
    (iii) to draw up a statistical balance of the hydrology.
